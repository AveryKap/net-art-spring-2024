    <h1>Queer-ying the Internet</h1>
    <h2>Curated by Avery Kaplan</h2>
    <p>
        For my exhibition, I wanted to focus on curating a queer digital art exhibit which highlights works that I find evocative, exciting, and outside the box. For something to embody queerness, It must go against some sort of expected norm in society and/or challenge heteronormative values. For the three works I choose, I wanted to provide different scales of queer art in the digital world. Queering the map presents itself as a large-scale project, where people from all over the world can add their own stories to their locations, free of bias or censorship. Similarly, protoword’s Museum of Queer art has a similar aim of showing queer life without censorship but does it on a more smaller community focused level. Museum of Queer art is an artwork itself, a method of archiving queer stories, and a metaverse space for people to connect with each other. Dal Chodha’s work represents the personal queer experience, by challenging the norms of what it means to interact with a website. The words call out to the viewer to signal significance but its mostly random or a method to lead you down a rabbit hole. The innovative, inclusive, and boundary breaking ways these websites present themselves solidify their place as important to queer culture.
