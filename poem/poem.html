    <h1>Kier</h1>
    <p>I woke in the middle of the night
        Just to see how you look when you're sleeping
        I don't need a conversation
        I just want to feel your vibration
        I know your dreaming
        And I hope it's about <em>me</em>
        <br>
        Sometimes you talk too much
        No words only melodies
        And there's nothing else to say
        Nothing else to say
        The words just get in the way
        I've got to find our melody
        &nbsp; Bring it back to me
        Cause I know that you can feel it when it's real
        There's a smile on your face
        And it reminds me
        How much I like my place
        <b>OOO</b> Right next to <b>you</b> </p>
